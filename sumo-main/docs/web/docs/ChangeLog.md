- [macOS launchers](Downloads.md#application_launchers) added for **sumo-gui**, **netedit** and the **osmWebWizard**. This allows to set **sumo-gui** as the default application to open `.sumocfg` files (to open a simulation by just double clicking a file) on macOS.
- extractTest.py now extracts tests for all variants (sumo, meso) which have specific outputs and got a lot better picking up all options

The optional boolean argument 'traceGetters' can be used to switch off tracing of data retrieval functions. Issue#6604, #7481
  - Added function 'vehicle.replaceStop' which replaces the upcoming stop with the given index and automatically adapts the route to the new stop edge. Issue #7226

The new behavior can be enabled by calling function traci.setLegacyGetLeader(False). In later versions this will be the default behavior. The return value 'None' is deprecated. Issue #7013
  - The function 'libsumo.vehicle.getNextStops' now returns a list of StopData objects rather than a list of tuples (the same result type returned by getStops) but different from the return type of 'traci.vehicle.getNextStops'. If the python script should be fully compatible between traci and libsumo, the new function 'vehicle.getStops' must be used.

- Tools
  - [randomTrips.py](Tools/Trip.md) now generates repeatable results by default (by using a fixed default seed). To obtain the prior random behavior without specifying a seed, the option **--random** can be used (just like for [sumo](sumo.md)). Issue #6989

- Documentation
  - Dark Mode added (not available on Internet Explorer)
  - Added documentation on [length-geometry-mismatch](Simulation/Distances.md)

- Releases
  - Version numbers of the python packages now follow the 1.6.0.post1234 scheme [see PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/)
  - Publishing Python packages on https://test.pypi.org/

### Enhancements
- Simulation
  - Taxi device now supports ride sharing. Issue #6544
  - Added option **--extrapolate-departpos**. When this option is set, vehicles with a departure time that lies between simulation steps have their depart position shifted forward to better reflect their position at the actual insertion time. This can greatly reduce depart delay and increase and insertion flow in high-flow situations. Issue #4277

  - Added option **--weights.priority-factor FLOAT** to factor the priority of edges into the routing decision with a configurable weight (edges with higher priority are preferred increasingly when setting this to a higher value). An application for this is [railway routing](Simulation/Railways.md#routing_on_bidirectional_tracks). Issue #6812
  - Added option **--device.rerouting.bike-speed** to compute aggregated speeds for bicycles separately. Issue #6829

- netedit
  - Added new 'Data Mode' to edit files with edge and turn-related data (`<edgeData>`, `<edgeRelation>`). Issue #6461
